This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Advanced Activity Tracker

We can keep track of every activity in a most efficient way with easy to use interface.


## Features

### Activity Creation
just like sending a simple message, things happen in real time.

### Revisit Activity
you can even revist activity that was in progess in the past by clicking the play button.It will create a revisit activity in the current time.

### Completion Status
You can even record when particular activity is done by clicking on the tick icon.
It even has the recursive completion functionality for the nested revisits.

### Dismiss activity
Sometimes you start an activity but it is not done or not happened due to some reasons.certain timed events cannot be revisited,it can be dismissed by clicking the cross icon.The best thing is that the activity wont disappear.

### Queue
There is also a queue tab,where you can keep the things/activities that comes to your mind,but you are not doing it right then.Those can be created in queue tab and you can move/add them to the main activity tab whenever you are pursuing them.

### Comment/Note
You can even turn the activity into comment/note instead of a timed activity.

### Dark Mode
Dark mode reduces strain on eyes.
